But, over the years the floor\nis bound to lose its luster, due to a number of reasons like stains, scratches,\netc. Usually, you would have to sand down the floor to raw wood, and then\nrefinish the floor to get back the previous glow. But, it is not always needed\nto sand down the floor. You can add a new coat of Polyurethane over the old\nfinish, and your floor can be renewed to its old shine.\n\n\n\nThe reason why polyurethane works is because, all wooden floors are protected by\na coating, and it is the coating that eventually gets the scratches and stains.\nNow, if the damage is not shallow, and the scratches are not too deep, you can\njust scuff-sand your floor using a buffer, and apply a fresh coat of\npolyurethane over it to finish.\n\nSome of the advantages of using a Polyurethane, compared to sanding down the\nfloor to bare wood are: It takes less time, effort, and cost.  The process\ncreates less dust and the floor can be recoated many times. Every-time you sand\ndown the floor to bare wood, you will remove some wood, and in case of laminated\nfloors, there is good chance that the plywood will be exposed after two or three\ntimes.  You can do the recoating all by yourselve if you allow at-least one full\nday for this work. \n\nBelow is a step by step procedure of recoating your floor using polyurethane.\n\n\n\n 1.  Tools and Materials\n\nAssemble all the tools and materials needed for recoating. For this process, you\nwill find all the tools and materials at your typical home-centers like Home\nDepot etc. The full list is at the end of this article and you save the list to\nyour project folder by selecting the \"Save to Project\" button.  We also have an\napp if you need to view the list while you are at the store. \n\n 2.  Clean the room and floor\n\nRemove all the things in the room including the furniture, wall-pictures, drapes\netc., and cover the permanent fixtures. Turn off the air conditioning, and cover\nall the vents to prevent the dust from circulating in the room. Scrape out any\ngunk on the floor, and clean the floor using a gentle cleaner liquid of your\nchoice. Spray the cleaner on the floor and wipe with a mop or a towel. Allow the\nfloor to dry before starting the work.\n\n\n\n 3.  Buffing\n\nIf your floor is in good shape (e.g. you coated it previously and/or you don't\nneed to sand out any scratches) you may be able to coat the flor without\nbuffing.  We have coated some floors skipping this step and they looked great. \nIn fact, the photos in this article are from a floor that has not been sanded or\nbuffed.  If you do need to buff the floor, hand-sand the perimeter of the floor\nusing 180-grit sand paper.  Swing the buffer left and right gently, starting\nfrom one side of the room and moving backwards. Make sure you put the dust mask\non before you start buffing. \n\n\n\n\n 4.  Vacuum and dry-tack\n\nAfter buffing, leave the room for 10 to 15 minutes. Vacuum the floor, and wipe\nit with a clean cloth dampened with mineral spirits. Make sure to keep the room\ndust free by using microfiber dry-tack cloth.\n\n 5.  Apply the finish\n\nThe last step is to apply the polyurethane. There are two types of\npolyurethanes, oil-based polyurethane and water-based polyurethane. \n\nThe durability of the products is not supposed to differ but I found that the\nwater-based poly lasted longer (about one year longer).  This is not scientific\nbut based on my experience using both. The other advantages of a water-based\npoly is that you can apply additional coates (necessary with both) in the same\nday (need to wait 2 hours between coats) and the fumes are not as strong.\n Overall the I have found the water based poly much easier to work with, easier\nto apply and lasts longer. \n\nHowever, if you have used a oil-based stain before and/or you want it a stain\nthat soaks into the wood grain (may darken the wood) then the oil-based stain\nmight be a better choice. \n\n\n\n\n Semi-gloss vs. Satin\n\nApply the finish, by cutting-in along the edges of the wall, using a\nhigh-quality bristle brush. Stop after ten minutes, since the finish may start\nto dry. Then, use a paint pad or roller to spread out the polyurethane across\nthe floor. Brush more along the edge, and repeat the above steps until all the\nfloor is covered.\n\n*Apply 3-5 coates. \n\n\nAfter re-coating, keep the floor untouched for about 12 to 18 hours. After that,\nthe floor can withstand light foot traffic. Avoid heavy foot traffic and moving\nfurniture for at-least 72 hours. Vacuum the floor frequently to remove dust.\nDon't use wax or oil soaps on polyurethane floor.\n\n\n\nProduct Name ClassTools\nPaint Brush1\n\nTools \n\nApplicator pad\n\nSanding paper - 180-grit sandpaper\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials\n\nWater-based Polyurethane\n\nClean cloths\n\nMicrofiber cloth","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hardwood floors gives elegant look to your house.

One of the easiest ways\nto find ways to cut your energy costs is performing a DIY home energy audit.\nThis is a simple way of surveying your home and finding where you are\nexperiencing heat loss or gain throughout your home. By using the simple\nhousehold materials and low cost tools this audit will help you obtain some of\nthe same recommendations you would receive from a professional audit. After\nperforming your audit you can take care of some of the cracks and air leaks\nyourself and cut your energy costs.\n\nWhat to check \nHere are several ways to check to see if there is an air leak around your home.\n We recommend at least a couple of these because it can be hard to detect an air\nleak, especially if it's on the smaller side of the spectrum. And don't kid\nyourself, even small and hard to find gaps can drive up your energy bill. The\nsmart kids say that even seemingly small gaps can equal having a window open.\n As they say - \"Waste not, want not\".\n\n * Check the Exterior Doors\n\nCheck around the door and see if there is weather-stripping on the outside of\nthe top and sides of the door.  You should see the weather-striping around the\nperimeter of these three sides.  Although there are different types (wood with\nfoam, metal with vinyl bulb), it should be a continuous and strip around the\ndoor.  In addition, there will be threshold at the bottom of the door that is\nsupposed to stop drafts in that section.\n\n * Check the door threshold\n   When it's daylight outside and relatively dark inside (turn off lights, close\n   window blinds) look at the bottom of the door with your eye-line close to the\n   floor. Put a blanket down on the floor so you don't smack your face on the\n   floor and watch for Fido as he might try to lick your face.  If you see any\n   daylight you need to replace your door threshold.\n\n * Check for drafts\n   This method works best if there is a difference in the inside and outside\n   temperature (hot or cold) or when it's gusty outside. Standing inside with\n   the door closed take a candle, incense stick or smoke pen check around your\n   exterior door. Through all the opening and shutting your doors have to endure\n   your weather stripping or doorstops can become extremely worn. Check to see\n   if you notice the flame/smoke from your candle/incense is consistently moving\n   (and not from a your breath or shaky hand).  If there is air movement caused\n   by a gap at the bottom of the door you will probably need to replace the door\n   threshold.\n\nIf the \"smoke\" is moving then here are a few other things to check:\n\n * Lift the door by the doorknob to check for loose hinges. If the door moves\n   \t\tupward, tighten the hinge screws. This might take care of the air leakage\n   but re-check after tightening.\n\n * If there is air movement around the top or sides of the door you may need to\n   replace the weather-stripping (or add weather-stripping if none exists).\n\nUsing a Flir phone imaging camera\nCheck the temperature difference between the door sides and the adjacent areas.\nThis can be accomplished with a thermal imaging camera. Flir makes a relatively\ninexpensive version for your Android or iPhone phone. Once you have it attached\nto your phone just point it at the door and it show you the variations in the\ntemperature between the door sides and the adjacent areas. It is important that\nthere is a difference in the inside and outside temperature (hot or cold) to\nshow any meaningful difference. If there is a \"cold\" spot (as evidenced by a\nblue glow along the bottom of the door), then you will need to replace the door\nthreshold.  Same idea for the top and sides of the door, except in this case you\nwould repair or replace the weather-striping.\n\nCheck around all Windows\nFirst check around the outside of the windows against your framing to see if air\nis coming in from the outside. If you have air coming in from the inside it is a\ngood idea to use a high quality caulking to seal around the window against your\nframes. If you have any cracks in your windows it is a good idea to replace the\nwindow panes. If you have insulated or double pane windows and you see that they\nare foggy or have moisture between your panes they need to be replaced because\npanes have lost their insulating value.\n\nI have found that the Flir imaging device camera very useful for windows because\nthe draft can come from a lack of insulation in the walls causing hot/cold\nspots.  And you might have a combination of factors such as missing insulation\nand a drafty window.  Replacing insulation is an entirely different project but\nhere are steps you can take to check if the problem in order of complexity and\ncost.\n\n * Even if you have double panned windows they can be cold/hot spots in your\n   home relative to the walls.  As an example, the Flir thermal image below\n   shows the difference in temperature between the window and adjacent wall.\n    The windows are double panned but a less expensive generic type.\n * If there are cold spots in the area of the molding it might mean that foam\n   insulation wasn't sprayed in the gaps.  In this case you would need to remove\n   the molding and insulate between the window and wall frame.  This is not a\n   trivial task so I would try the other options first or at least wait until\n   the weather and time is favorable for this type of project.\n * One option is to put in window inserts.  We have a whole article on window\n   inserts but the TLDR (too long don't read) version is that they are thin\n   interior frames with plexiglass that provide an energy seal. It's important\n   that the window inserts create a seal so there is an air gap between your\n   existing window and the window insert.\n\n * If you have what appears to be hot or cold spots in your walls it doesn't\n   necessarily mean that you need insulation.  The thermal imaging also picks up\n   water, ducting and other things going on behind your wall that may not need\n   any \"fixing\".  For instance, if the thermal image picks up your duct it could\n   show it as a \"cold\" blue color. The point is that the image gives you a place\n   to start your investigation.  Those that are in the trades will probably know\n   the cause but if you are new to this take pause and don't just start ripping\n   walls apart. That is why I would recommend the least intrusive step first and\n   then once that is completed re-test the area. And take small steps to make\n   sure your hypothesis is correct (e.g. there is an uninsulated area in my\n   wall, etc.).\n\n\nCheck around Electrical Outlets and Switches\nThis may not seem to be a likely place for air to be entering into your home but\nyou will be surprised. Air can enter through your sockets and switches if there\nis a gap in the insulation or if the socket and switch plates are not sealed.\n\nYou can purchase a simple kit that consists of precut foam rubber that you can\nplace over your receptacles and switches. You just simply pull your cover off\nand place the foam over you receptacles and put the covers back on. This is a\ngreat cheap and easy way to fix this problem.\n\nIf you notice that there is no insulation behind the electrical outlet or switch\nyou may want to do more investigation (remove a small piece of drywall to see if\nthe insulation is inadequate.  And don't be afraid to call a specialist if you\ndon't have the time or energy to do the work.\n\nCheck around Ceiling Fixtures\nFirst check around the outside of the windows against your framing to see if air\nis coming in from the outside. If you have air coming in from the inside it is a\ngood idea to use a high quality caulking to seal around the window against your\nframes. If you have any cracks in your windows it is a good idea to replace the\nwindow panes. If you have insulated or double pane windows and you see that they\nare foggy or have moisture between your panes they need to be replaced because\npanes have lost their insulating value.\n\nFireplaces\nWood fireplaces are notoriously inefficient heating devices. After using the\nfireplace make sure you close the flute.  In addition, it is a good idea to test\nto see if there are air drafts and/or cold spots in and around your fireplace.\n An easy fix is to put a fireplace pad or balloon next to the closed flute to\nseal it.  Be sure to tie a colorful string and let it hang down so you remember\nto remove it before using your fireplace.\n\nThese are just a few helpful tricks to help you cut down on the energy loss that\noccurs through your home. Every little bit is important. The more gaps we fix\nthe more energy we save. We can lose as much energy through all the cracks\ncombined together as a window or door being left open. Try these tips and you\nwill undoubtably save money on heating and cooling.\n\n\n\nTools\nSmoke pen [https://www.amazon.com/Regin-Smoke-Pen-Hours-S220/dp/B00788GC6S]\nFlir Thermal imaging camera\nTape measure\n\nMaterials\nCandle\n[https://www.amazon.com/Homesick-HSCA1-DEN-WH01-Scented-Candle-Denver/dp/B076BH66N2/]\nInsense stick","html":"<h2 id=\"cutting-energy-costs\">Cutting Energy Costs</h2><p>Most of us are keen to cut energy costs and save money.

If there is a \"cold\" spot (as evidenced by a blue glow along the bottom of the door), then you will need to replace the door threshold.  Same idea for the top and sides of the door, except in this case you would repair or replace the weather-striping.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://homeimproov.com/content/images/2019/11/energy-audit1_600-1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p><strong>Check around all Windows</strong><br>First check around the outside of the windows against your framing to see if air is coming in from the outside. If you have air coming in from the inside it is a good idea to use a high quality caulking to seal around the window against your frames. If you have any cracks in your windows it is a good idea to replace the window panes. If you have insulated or double pane windows and you see that they are foggy or have moisture between your panes they need to be replaced because panes have lost their insulating value.</p><p>I have found that the Flir imaging device camera very useful for windows because the draft can come from a lack of insulation in the walls causing hot/cold spots.  And you might have a combination of factors such as missing insulation and a drafty window.  Replacing insulation is an entirely different project but here are steps you can take to check if the problem in order of complexity and cost.</p><ul><li>Even if you have double panned windows they can be cold/hot spots in your home relative to the walls.  As an example, the Flir thermal image below shows the difference in temperature between the window and adjacent wall.  The windows are double panned but a less expensive generic type.</li><li>If there are cold spots in the area of the molding it might mean that foam insulation wasn't sprayed in the gaps.  In this case you would need to remove the molding and insulate between the window and wall frame.  This is not a trivial task so I would try the other options first or at least wait until the weather and time is favorable for this type of project.</li><li>One option is to put in window inserts.  We have a whole article on window inserts but the TLDR (too long don't read) version is that they are thin interior frames with plexiglass that provide an energy seal. It's important that the window inserts create a seal so there is an air gap between your existing window and the window insert.</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://homeimproov.com/content/images/2019/12/window_inserts2_600.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><ul><li>If you have what appears to be hot or cold spots in your walls it doesn't necessarily mean that you need insulation.  The thermal imaging also picks up water, ducting and other things going on behind your wall that may not need any \"fixing\".  For instance, if the thermal image picks up your duct it could show it as a \"cold\" blue color. The point is that the image gives you a place to start your investigation.  Those that are in the trades will probably know the cause but if you are new to this take pause and don't just start ripping walls apart. That is why I would recommend the least intrusive step first and then once that is completed re-test the area. And take small steps to make sure your hypothesis is correct (e.g. there is an uninsulated area in my wall, etc.).</li></ul><p><br><strong>Check around Electrical Outlets and Switches</strong><br>This may not seem to be a likely place for air to be entering into your home but you will be surprised. Air can enter through your sockets and switches if there is a gap in the insulation or if the socket and switch plates are not sealed.</p><p>You can purchase a simple kit that consists of precut foam rubber that you can place over your receptacles and switches. You just simply pull your cover off and place the foam over you receptacles and put the covers back on. This is a great cheap and easy way to fix this problem.</p><p>If you notice that there is no insulation behind the electrical outlet or switch you may want to do more investigation (remove a small piece of drywall to see if the insulation is inadequate.  And don't be afraid to call a specialist if you don't have the time or energy to do the work.</p><p><strong>Check around Ceiling Fixtures</strong><br>First check around the outside of the windows against your framing to see if air is coming in from the outside. If you have air coming in from the inside it is a good idea to use a high quality caulking to seal around the window against your frames.

If you have insulated or double pane windows and you see that they are foggy or have moisture between your panes they need to be replaced because panes have lost their insulating value.</p><p><strong>Fireplaces</strong><br>Wood fireplaces are notoriously inefficient heating devices. After using the fireplace make sure you close the flute.  In addition, it is a good idea to test to see if there are air drafts and/or cold spots in and around your fireplace.  An easy fix is to put a fireplace pad or balloon next to the closed flute to seal it.  Be sure to tie a colorful string and let it hang down so you remember to remove it before using your fireplace.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://homeimproov.com/content/images/2019/12/fireplace-600.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt></figure><p>These are just a few helpful tricks to help you cut down on the energy loss that occurs through your home. Every little bit is important. The more gaps we fix the more energy we save. We can lose as much energy through all the cracks combined together as a window or door being left open. Try these tips and you will undoubtably save money on heating and cooling.</p><p></p><h3 id=\"tools\">Tools</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Regin-Smoke-Pen-Hours-S220/dp/B00788GC6S\">Smoke pen </a><br>Flir Thermal imaging camera<br>Tape measure</p><h3 id=\"materials\">Materials</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Homesick-HSCA1-DEN-WH01-Scented-Candle-Denver/dp/B076BH66N2/\">Candle<br></a>Insense stick</p><p></p>","url":"https://homeimproov.com/diy-home-energy-audit/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"43c0d72e-9961-4417-bd53-64b9ee10982a","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":"<style>\n#tools {\n}\n\n#materials {\n\n}\n    \n</style>\n\n","codeinjection_styles":"\n#tools {\n}\n\n#materials {\n\n}\n    \n","comment_id":"5dc9d0ef2e31dd404703c5d2","reading_time":7}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"indoor","limit":10,"skip":0,"numberOfPages":1,"humanPageNumber":1,"prevPageNumber":null,"nextPageNumber":null,"previousPagePath":null,"nextPagePath":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2358152166","2561578252","2731221146","3627573779","4145280475"]}
