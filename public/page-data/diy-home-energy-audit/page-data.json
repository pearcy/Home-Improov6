One of the easiest ways\nto find ways to cut your energy costs is performing a DIY home energy audit.\nThis is a simple way of surveying your home and finding where you are\nexperiencing heat loss or gain throughout your home. By using the simple\nhousehold materials and low cost tools this audit will help you obtain some of\nthe same recommendations you would receive from a professional audit. After\nperforming your audit you can take care of some of the cracks and air leaks\nyourself and cut your energy costs.\n\nWhat to check \nHere are several ways to check to see if there is an air leak around your home.\n We recommend at least a couple of these because it can be hard to detect an air\nleak, especially if it's on the smaller side of the spectrum. And don't kid\nyourself, even small and hard to find gaps can drive up your energy bill. The\nsmart kids say that even seemingly small gaps can equal having a window open.\n As they say - \"Waste not, want not\".\n\n * Check the Exterior Doors\n\nCheck around the door and see if there is weather-stripping on the outside of\nthe top and sides of the door.  You should see the weather-striping around the\nperimeter of these three sides.  Although there are different types (wood with\nfoam, metal with vinyl bulb), it should be a continuous and strip around the\ndoor.  In addition, there will be threshold at the bottom of the door that is\nsupposed to stop drafts in that section.\n\n * Check the door threshold\n   When it's daylight outside and relatively dark inside (turn off lights, close\n   window blinds) look at the bottom of the door with your eye-line close to the\n   floor. Put a blanket down on the floor so you don't smack your face on the\n   floor and watch for Fido as he might try to lick your face.  If you see any\n   daylight you need to replace your door threshold.\n\n * Check for drafts\n   This method works best if there is a difference in the inside and outside\n   temperature (hot or cold) or when it's gusty outside. Standing inside with\n   the door closed take a candle, incense stick or smoke pen check around your\n   exterior door. Through all the opening and shutting your doors have to endure\n   your weather stripping or doorstops can become extremely worn. Check to see\n   if you notice the flame/smoke from your candle/incense is consistently moving\n   (and not from a your breath or shaky hand).  If there is air movement caused\n   by a gap at the bottom of the door you will probably need to replace the door\n   threshold.\n\nIf the \"smoke\" is moving then here are a few other things to check:\n\n * Lift the door by the doorknob to check for loose hinges. If the door moves\n   \t\tupward, tighten the hinge screws. This might take care of the air leakage\n   but re-check after tightening.\n\n * If there is air movement around the top or sides of the door you may need to\n   replace the weather-stripping (or add weather-stripping if none exists).\n\nUsing a Flir phone imaging camera\nCheck the temperature difference between the door sides and the adjacent areas.\nThis can be accomplished with a thermal imaging camera. Flir makes a relatively\ninexpensive version for your Android or iPhone phone. Once you have it attached\nto your phone just point it at the door and it show you the variations in the\ntemperature between the door sides and the adjacent areas. It is important that\nthere is a difference in the inside and outside temperature (hot or cold) to\nshow any meaningful difference. If there is a \"cold\" spot (as evidenced by a\nblue glow along the bottom of the door), then you will need to replace the door\nthreshold.  Same idea for the top and sides of the door, except in this case you\nwould repair or replace the weather-striping.\n\nCheck around all Windows\nFirst check around the outside of the windows against your framing to see if air\nis coming in from the outside. If you have air coming in from the inside it is a\ngood idea to use a high quality caulking to seal around the window against your\nframes. If you have any cracks in your windows it is a good idea to replace the\nwindow panes. If you have insulated or double pane windows and you see that they\nare foggy or have moisture between your panes they need to be replaced because\npanes have lost their insulating value.\n\nI have found that the Flir imaging device camera very useful for windows because\nthe draft can come from a lack of insulation in the walls causing hot/cold\nspots.  And you might have a combination of factors such as missing insulation\nand a drafty window.  Replacing insulation is an entirely different project but\nhere are steps you can take to check if the problem in order of complexity and\ncost.\n\n * Even if you have double panned windows they can be cold/hot spots in your\n   home relative to the walls.  As an example, the Flir thermal image below\n   shows the difference in temperature between the window and adjacent wall.\n    The windows are double panned but a less expensive generic type.\n * If there are cold spots in the area of the molding it might mean that foam\n   insulation wasn't sprayed in the gaps.  In this case you would need to remove\n   the molding and insulate between the window and wall frame.  This is not a\n   trivial task so I would try the other options first or at least wait until\n   the weather and time is favorable for this type of project.\n * One option is to put in window inserts.  We have a whole article on window\n   inserts but the TLDR (too long don't read) version is that they are thin\n   interior frames with plexiglass that provide an energy seal. It's important\n   that the window inserts create a seal so there is an air gap between your\n   existing window and the window insert.\n\n * If you have what appears to be hot or cold spots in your walls it doesn't\n   necessarily mean that you need insulation.  The thermal imaging also picks up\n   water, ducting and other things going on behind your wall that may not need\n   any \"fixing\".  For instance, if the thermal image picks up your duct it could\n   show it as a \"cold\" blue color. The point is that the image gives you a place\n   to start your investigation.  Those that are in the trades will probably know\n   the cause but if you are new to this take pause and don't just start ripping\n   walls apart. That is why I would recommend the least intrusive step first and\n   then once that is completed re-test the area. And take small steps to make\n   sure your hypothesis is correct (e.g. there is an uninsulated area in my\n   wall, etc.).\n\n\nCheck around Electrical Outlets and Switches\nThis may not seem to be a likely place for air to be entering into your home but\nyou will be surprised. Air can enter through your sockets and switches if there\nis a gap in the insulation or if the socket and switch plates are not sealed.\n\nYou can purchase a simple kit that consists of precut foam rubber that you can\nplace over your receptacles and switches. You just simply pull your cover off\nand place the foam over you receptacles and put the covers back on. This is a\ngreat cheap and easy way to fix this problem.\n\nIf you notice that there is no insulation behind the electrical outlet or switch\nyou may want to do more investigation (remove a small piece of drywall to see if\nthe insulation is inadequate.  And don't be afraid to call a specialist if you\ndon't have the time or energy to do the work.\n\nCheck around Ceiling Fixtures\nFirst check around the outside of the windows against your framing to see if air\nis coming in from the outside. If you have air coming in from the inside it is a\ngood idea to use a high quality caulking to seal around the window against your\nframes. If you have any cracks in your windows it is a good idea to replace the\nwindow panes. If you have insulated or double pane windows and you see that they\nare foggy or have moisture between your panes they need to be replaced because\npanes have lost their insulating value.\n\nFireplaces\nWood fireplaces are notoriously inefficient heating devices. After using the\nfireplace make sure you close the flute.  In addition, it is a good idea to test\nto see if there are air drafts and/or cold spots in and around your fireplace.\n An easy fix is to put a fireplace pad or balloon next to the closed flute to\nseal it.  Be sure to tie a colorful string and let it hang down so you remember\nto remove it before using your fireplace.\n\nThese are just a few helpful tricks to help you cut down on the energy loss that\noccurs through your home. Every little bit is important. The more gaps we fix\nthe more energy we save. We can lose as much energy through all the cracks\ncombined together as a window or door being left open. Try these tips and you\nwill undoubtably save money on heating and cooling.\n\n\n\nTools\nSmoke pen [https://www.amazon.com/Regin-Smoke-Pen-Hours-S220/dp/B00788GC6S]\nFlir Thermal imaging camera\nTape measure\n\nMaterials\nCandle\n[https://www.amazon.com/Homesick-HSCA1-DEN-WH01-Scented-Candle-Denver/dp/B076BH66N2/]\nInsense stick","html":"<h2 id=\"cutting-energy-costs\">Cutting Energy Costs</h2><p>Most of us are keen to cut energy costs and save money.
