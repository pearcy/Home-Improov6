But, over the years the floor\nis bound to lose its luster, due to a number of reasons like stains, scratches,\netc. Usually, you would have to sand down the floor to raw wood, and then\nrefinish the floor to get back the previous glow. But, it is not always needed\nto sand down the floor. You can add a new coat of Polyurethane over the old\nfinish, and your floor can be renewed to its old shine.\n\n\n\nThe reason why polyurethane works is because, all wooden floors are protected by\na coating, and it is the coating that eventually gets the scratches and stains.\nNow, if the damage is not shallow, and the scratches are not too deep, you can\njust scuff-sand your floor using a buffer, and apply a fresh coat of\npolyurethane over it to finish.\n\nSome of the advantages of using a Polyurethane, compared to sanding down the\nfloor to bare wood are: It takes less time, effort, and cost.  The process\ncreates less dust and the floor can be recoated many times. Every-time you sand\ndown the floor to bare wood, you will remove some wood, and in case of laminated\nfloors, there is good chance that the plywood will be exposed after two or three\ntimes.  You can do the recoating all by yourselve if you allow at-least one full\nday for this work. \n\nBelow is a step by step procedure of recoating your floor using polyurethane.\n\n\n\n 1.  Tools and Materials\n\nAssemble all the tools and materials needed for recoating. For this process, you\nwill find all the tools and materials at your typical home-centers like Home\nDepot etc. The full list is at the end of this article and you save the list to\nyour project folder by selecting the \"Save to Project\" button.  We also have an\napp if you need to view the list while you are at the store. \n\n 2.  Clean the room and floor\n\nRemove all the things in the room including the furniture, wall-pictures, drapes\netc., and cover the permanent fixtures. Turn off the air conditioning, and cover\nall the vents to prevent the dust from circulating in the room. Scrape out any\ngunk on the floor, and clean the floor using a gentle cleaner liquid of your\nchoice. Spray the cleaner on the floor and wipe with a mop or a towel. Allow the\nfloor to dry before starting the work.\n\n\n\n 3.  Buffing\n\nIf your floor is in good shape (e.g. you coated it previously and/or you don't\nneed to sand out any scratches) you may be able to coat the flor without\nbuffing.  We have coated some floors skipping this step and they looked great. \nIn fact, the photos in this article are from a floor that has not been sanded or\nbuffed.  If you do need to buff the floor, hand-sand the perimeter of the floor\nusing 180-grit sand paper.  Swing the buffer left and right gently, starting\nfrom one side of the room and moving backwards. Make sure you put the dust mask\non before you start buffing. \n\n\n\n\n 4.  Vacuum and dry-tack\n\nAfter buffing, leave the room for 10 to 15 minutes. Vacuum the floor, and wipe\nit with a clean cloth dampened with mineral spirits. Make sure to keep the room\ndust free by using microfiber dry-tack cloth.\n\n 5.  Apply the finish\n\nThe last step is to apply the polyurethane. There are two types of\npolyurethanes, oil-based polyurethane and water-based polyurethane. \n\nThe durability of the products is not supposed to differ but I found that the\nwater-based poly lasted longer (about one year longer).  This is not scientific\nbut based on my experience using both. The other advantages of a water-based\npoly is that you can apply additional coates (necessary with both) in the same\nday (need to wait 2 hours between coats) and the fumes are not as strong.\n Overall the I have found the water based poly much easier to work with, easier\nto apply and lasts longer. \n\nHowever, if you have used a oil-based stain before and/or you want it a stain\nthat soaks into the wood grain (may darken the wood) then the oil-based stain\nmight be a better choice. \n\n\n\n\n Semi-gloss vs. Satin\n\nApply the finish, by cutting-in along the edges of the wall, using a\nhigh-quality bristle brush. Stop after ten minutes, since the finish may start\nto dry. Then, use a paint pad or roller to spread out the polyurethane across\nthe floor. Brush more along the edge, and repeat the above steps until all the\nfloor is covered.\n\n*Apply 3-5 coates. \n\n\nAfter re-coating, keep the floor untouched for about 12 to 18 hours. After that,\nthe floor can withstand light foot traffic. Avoid heavy foot traffic and moving\nfurniture for at-least 72 hours. Vacuum the floor frequently to remove dust.\nDon't use wax or oil soaps on polyurethane floor.\n\n\n\nProduct Name ClassTools\nPaint Brush1\n\nTools \n\nApplicator pad\n\nSanding paper - 180-grit sandpaper\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials\n\nWater-based Polyurethane\n\nClean cloths\n\nMicrofiber cloth","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hardwood floors gives elegant look to your house.
